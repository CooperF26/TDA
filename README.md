Run code by running cells in jupyter notebooks from top to bottom. 
Note ended up using different dataset from cd /scratch/zzhang30/cs420/data on bg13 instead of what TDA_Project.ipynb produces
Otherwise should get all expected results assuming computer running code has sufficient computational power
No other things to keep track of
